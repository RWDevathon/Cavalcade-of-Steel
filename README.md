# Description
A mod using Artificial Beings Framework (ABF), Synstructs Core (ABF:SC) and several of the content submods to bring a terrible foe - or a troubling ally - to RimWorld. Not all synstructs admire their human creators, and some are willing to go to inordinate lengths to carve out their own place among the stars. These synstructs will declare war on all which lives and only consider the most compliant or kindred of synstructs to be worthy of sparing. With advanced technology and legions of drones at their disposal, peace with the organic filth is no option for them.

## Features
* A faction using various other content submods of Synstructs Core to bring hostility and warfare to the Rim.
* A unique mechanic for the faction, delivering ultimatums to and eventually declaring war on any player faction that has organics.

## Known Issues/Incompatibilities
* Issues may be out there, but none are known at the moment.
