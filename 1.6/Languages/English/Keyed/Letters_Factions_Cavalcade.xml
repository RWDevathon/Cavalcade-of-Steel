    <ABF_CavalcadeDeclarationOfWarDesc>A communique across all frequencies has been received: "By protecting organic filth, you have chosen death." It isn't addressed to anyone, but judging by the dry, robotic tone and the fact that this is exactly when the ultimatum from {0} was set to expire, there can only be one conclusion: This is a declaration of war against you by {0}. They might reconsider their stance if all organics were to disappear.</ABF_CavalcadeDeclarationOfWarDesc>
