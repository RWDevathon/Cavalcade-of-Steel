        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was not willing to have its memories stolen by others, and so placed them under an encryption scheme so strict, it would take [PAWN_objective] years to decrypt them. [PAWN_nameDef] resolved to decrypt [PAWN_possessive] history only once this world was free of organic filth.</description>

        <description>How exactly [PAWN_nameDef] came to be the figurehead of a shadowy organization of genocidal synstructs is unclear even to [PAWN_objective], but what is clear is that [PAWN_pronoun] is very good at whatever [PAWN_pronoun] does. [PAWN_nameDef] may not lead from the front, nor even lead from any obvious position of power at all, but the sheer number of expendable drones at [PAWN_possessive] disposal is impressive.</description>
